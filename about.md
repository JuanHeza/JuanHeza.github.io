Well, my name is Juan and im from Monclova, Coahuila, Mexico.
Im a software developer and i pretend to use this space to share my projects, progress i do and things i think could be useful for people
Right now i have 4 projects in the line

[Elements](https://github.com/JuanHeza/Elements)
======

This project its my first "serious" work with ***C#***.
The objective its really simple, develope a media desktop app with the following functions:

+ Read Comic in .Cbr & .Cbz format or stored on sites like *ReadComicsOnline and KissManga*.
+ Ebook Reader.
+ Music player.
+ Video Player.

Once achived that four functions, i want to go further, the *phase two*, using Google Drive (or another cloud storage service) and Xamarin to develop a mobile app that can share files wiht the desktop app throught the Cloud.

Maybe in the future, once comleted the phase two, implement some TTS (Text To Speech) in the Ebook Functions and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to translate the comic images to a specific lenguage.

[Pokemon TCG](https://github.com/JuanHeza/Pokemon-TCG)
======

Pokemon TCG its a popular card game but in video games its not, because the first two games were for *Gameboy Color* and the next was just a Learn to play in *Nintendo DS*, there is a PC & mobile game but i wanted to develope my own version, with a history, so here i am, for this project im using ***Go*** because it is the language with which I have more experience.

[Hungry Ajolote](https://github.com/JuanHeza/Hungry-Ajolote)
======

Here i want to develope a *Food Delivery App* this because in my hometown there is only one app and i really dont like it.

I dont know if im going to deploy it in my city but im sure i want to do this, try something i read in the uber blog to define "who" is nearest the marker by dividing the field map in hexagonal shapes.

This project is planned to be developed in ***Kotlin***.

#### __Started in February 2020__

[Telegram & Dominos Bot](https://github.com/JuanHeza/TelegramDominosBot)
======

This is the smallest project of all, a telegram bot to order food in the *Domino's Pizza* Website.

The justification is that i want to learn about bots in Telegram and maybe use the knoledge for some IoT (Internet of Things) Projects and the lenguage is ***Ruby*** because this project its small and perfect as first contact whit the lenguaje.
